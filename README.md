# AgriFusion
From Soil Signals to Crop Success. Fusion of Sustainable agricultural models which predict soil health, gives crop predictor based on soil health and recommends the fertilizer to crop.

# üåæ AgriFusion ‚Äì Unified Intelligence for Crops, Fertilizers, and Soil Health

AgriFusion is an AI-powered system designed to promote **sustainable agriculture** by analyzing soil health, predicting the most suitable crop, and recommending the ideal fertilizer. The solution helps reduce fertilizer misuse, enhance crop productivity, and support long-term soil care ‚Äî aligned with the UN's **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**.

## üöÄ Problem Statement

With the rising global population, the need for sustainable food production is more critical than ever. Traditional farming lacks precision and often leads to:
- Overuse of chemical fertilizers
- Soil degradation
- Reduced biodiversity

AgriFusion addresses these challenges by providing **data-driven recommendations** to farmers using machine learning.
